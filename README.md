# Customer-Segmentation
Data Science Modelling - Customer Segmentation

Done by: Ng Chuen Siong, Nelson

Project aims to determine which customer target segments to focus on to increase sales revenues of a shopping mall. Dataset is obtained from Kaggle. Data science modelling skills in python programming are demonstrated by using unsupervised machine learning models (clustering algorithms) for cluster analysis and supervised machine learning models (regression and classification models) for predictive analytics to identify the customer target segments to focus on and factors that increase customer spending. To optimize modelsâ€™ performance, models are trained, evaluated, validated, and fine-tuned until they are able to generalize well and achieve an acceptable set of accuracy and AUC scores for prediction.

Owing to Github size limit, the project has to be uploaded to Google Drive instead. Click <b>[here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1mrnr8CGJDkjLr_9X-fchbC61kX53vlLN?usp=sharing)</b> to go to the Google Drive and download Python project.

Items to download to run the program:
1. Data folder (with Cust_analysis.csv)
2. Customer Segmentation.ipynb
3. my_Functions_cp_clean.py
4. my_Functions_cp_graph.py
5. my_Functions_cp_model.py
6. my_Functions_cp_wrangle.py

Note: To shorten the running time, the EDA section can be skipped.
