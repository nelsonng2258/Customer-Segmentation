# Customer-Segmentation
Data Science Modelling - Customer Segmentation

Project aims to determine which customer target segments to focus on to increase sales revenues at department stores. Dataset is obtained from Kaggle. Data science modelling skills in python programming are demonstrated by using unsupervised machine learning models (clustering algorithms) for exploratory data analysis and supervised machine learning models (regression and classification models) for predictive analytics to identify the customer target segments to focus on and factors that increase customer spending. To optimize modelsâ€™ performance, models are trained, evaluated, validated, and fine-tuned until they achieved an acceptable set of accuracy and AUC for prediction.
